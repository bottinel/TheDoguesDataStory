In this study, we tried to evaluate the usefulness of Wikipedia as a tool for studying misinformation across multiple languages and use it as a way to explore online users' relationship with COVID-related fake news during limited mobility periods. Through the different steps of this project, we could extract some key findings.

First, we could prove that indeed there is a significant increase in attention in fake news from before to during the lockdown, and especially in COVID-related fake news. Regarding the themes that sparked the most interest, prevention and mortality are at the first place.

Then, we could prove that the topics classified as Fake News on Wikipedia are representative of general media attention with an 85% match. We could also create a timeline of interest and relate them with the mobility change points.

Finally, we could detect a surprising difference between localised and international languages, namely Spanish and Portuguese, which don't have many themes in common even if they can be considered international languages.
