		<h1 class="editable no-wrap">Welcome to the <strong>Wiki</strong> <strong>Wacky</strong> Covid news factory!</strong></h1>
                <p class="subtext editable">Do you remember when we were in lockdown, already 3 years ago? You certainly must remember about reading strange "news" circling on the internet, like that drinking hand disinfectant could kill the virus in the body, or that a certain billionaire put microchips in the vaccines... Of course some of them were so outlandish that were impossible to believe, but other news were perfectly credible – Vitamin C cures covid, Covid remains in the body permanently. Anyways these news or conspiracy theories were (and still are) a source of interest for a lost of us. How do we inform ourselves about them? For most of us the main source of general information is <strong>Wikipedia</strong>, which strives to be a neutral platform vigilant against misinformation. For this reason a page is never explicitly labelled as “fake”, but we can still cluster articles related to a certain Fake news topic and analyse its page view count in a certain period of time. As such, page visits of properly clustered articles are a powerful tool to monitor interest related to a specific fake news, and whether it was used by users as a resource to fact check, or a way to go deeper down the rabbit hole doesn’t matter. In this project, we want to evaluate the usefulness of Wikipedia as a tool for studying misinformation. </p>

				<h2> Can we extract fake news from Wikipedia?</h2>
				<p> During the period of interest (lockdown of 2020) with respect to the other years, is there a statistically significant increase in views for pages related to fake news compared to other articles in Wikipedia? It's interesting to investigate what this tells us about the public’s interests: can we differentiate the increase in fake news interest from the general increase in traffic to wikipedia during the lockdown period? And what about Covid-related news? </p>

				<h2>Covid fake news around the world </h2>
				<p>How different are the past analysis if we consider different languages? Are there cultural differences between popular fake news or do they overlap? Finally, can we link this with country-specific mobility change points and government interventions?   </p>
